The Mission :ocean:
A lockdown forbids a lot of things, but your imagination has all the freedom it needs. What if we were thirsty from climbing the table mountain in South-Africa right now, or sunbathing a nice Hawaiian beach and in dire need of a cocktail? One thing is for sure - we'd need to calculate how many Euros that way-too-expensive drink will be ðŸ’¸

Specifications
Must-have features
Pick your next travel destination and check the exchange rate: local currency / Euros.
Make a small webpage where you can enter the local rate (use a form) and it'll tell you the price in Euros.
Use a form that submits to PHP (no JS allowed / no preventDefault)
Nice-to-have features
Allow the user to choose between different currencies
Provide a button to switch the from / to valuta types (So Euro -> Dollar becomes Dollar --> Euro)
